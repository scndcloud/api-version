Axum middleware to rewrite a request such that a version prefix is added to the path. This is based on a set of versions and an optional `"x-api-version"` custom HTTP header: if no such header is present, the highest version is used. Yet this only applies to requests the URIs of which pass a filter; others are not rewritten.

Requests for the readiness probe `"/"` are not rewritten.

Paths must not start with a version prefix, e.g. `"/v0"`.

## Example

```rust
use api_version::api_version;

let app = Router::new()
    .route("/", get(ok_0))
    .route("/v0/test", get(ok_0))
    .route("/v1/test", get(ok_1));

/// Create an [ApiVersionLayer] correctly initialized with non-empty and strictly monotonically
/// increasing versions in the given inclusive range as well as an [ApiVersionFilter] making all
/// requests be rewritten.
let app = api_version!(0..=1).layer(app);
```
